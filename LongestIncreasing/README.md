# Longest Increasing Subsequence.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project Objective:

As a developer, write a program to find the longest increasing subsequence.

 

## Background of the problem statement:

As a developer, write a Java code to find the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers.

We don't assume any fixed interval. Numbers need not be consecutive.

Sequences should not be disjointed.  A subsequence should have a start and an end index in an array 
and include every element between start and end. 

The indices have to be sequential.  They themselves should be increasing but not strictly consecutive.

A sequence must be increasing.  2,2,2 is not a sequence because 2 = and is not increasing.

Your solution should be no worse than polynomial O(n^2) in complexity, but if it can be improved, then that is encouraged.

Example:

`[7,4,3,5,6,9,10,8,6,15]` : Longest Sequence is `[3,5,6,9,10]`
`[1,4,3,2,5,9,3,4,1,10]` : Longest Sequence is `[2,5,9]`
 

You must use the following:

  * Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application.
  * Java: A programming language.
  * Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub.
  * GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions. 
  * Core Java concepts: variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static.
 

Following requirements should be met:

  * The versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories.
  * The code should work properly for n numbers, where n<100.
